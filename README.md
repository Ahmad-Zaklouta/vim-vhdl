# vim-vhdl #

Syntax highlighting and scripting for VHDL files. Based on the VHDL syntax and 
script files included with VIM by default. Some changes from the default:

- Some VHDL-2008 highlighting support
- Comment continuation works and supports Doxygen-style comments too
- Syntax highlighting tweaks


Installation
==============
For installing this into vim, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply
copy and paste:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/cognoscan/vim-vhdl.git
